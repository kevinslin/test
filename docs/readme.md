> "We are overwhelmed with information and we don't have the tools to properly index and filter through it. [The development of these tools, which] will give society access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages [should] be the first objective of our scientist" - Vannevar Bush, 1945

Dendron is a **hierarchal** knowledge management tool that **grows** as you do.

Think of it as a **second brain** to help you make sense of all the information you care about.

Dendron does this by helping you **store and find notes** via **flexible hierarchies**. Notes are stored as plain [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) files with [frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/). To read more about the ideas that inspired Dendron, you can read [this blog post](https://kevinslin.com/organizing/its_not_you_its_your_knowledge_base/).

# Principles

1. Simple: Dendron should be a frictionless way to store, connect, and share knowledge.
2. Fast: Dendron should be the fastest way to work with the information you care about.
3. Extensible: Dendron should

# Features
